# Dead Space RIG

This project focuses on recreating the health bar portion of the player's RIG in the Dead Space videogame franchise. RIG stands for "Resource Integration Gear"; this equipment serves a multitude of purposes to the player in the game. Using an Arduino Uno along with other electrical components, this project sought to manifest the health bar presented by the RIG within the game. One of the challenges faced when assembling this project involved assessing and replacing the Arduino Uno's role as the power supply. This was due to the Arduino Uno's current limit via its individual pins. The problem was solved by providing an external power supply through a rechargable battery. Another challenge encountered during setup concerned the resistance attributed to each LED. Due to overestimation of the current flowing through each LED, many of the resistors were replaced in the final setup.
